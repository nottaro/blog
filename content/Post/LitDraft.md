Yes, the spelling was intentional. No, I'm not bad at English. It'll make sense later.

Wassup Ouyang Gang.

Dr Ouyang Yu (Phd in Aus Lit), has many poems, ranging from criticisms of immigrant life in Australia, to existentialism. However, as he has a wide myriad of poems, I'll be discussing the ones that relate to his immigrant view of Australia, found in *New and Selected*.

However, I highly recommend you have a look at his other anthologies too. I've provided a link to the poems discussed down below, but a list of his works can be found [here](https://www.poetryinternational.com/en/poets-poems/poets/poet/102-684_Yu)

Australia is no stranger to refugees and immigrants, with over 7.6 migrants living in Australia ([source](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/migration-australia/latest-release)). However, you may remember the "Stop The Boats" movement, initiated by current PM Tony Abbot, as a "decent, humane and compassionate" action against refugees ([source](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-64898507)). This supported the stigma against refugees and migrants, that was already prevalent in Australia, a predominantly Caucasian country.

### The Ungrateful Immigrant

So from what I could tell, Ouyang represents immigrant life as lacking, **because** of the multiple opportunities offered, and challenges the cultural diversity of Australia. He perceives the expectations set upon immigrants as unrealistic, and this is highlighted in his poem, [*The Ungrateful Immigrant*](https://www.poetryinternational.com/en/poets-poems/poems/poem/103-825_THE-UNGRATEFUL-IMMIGRANT).

What I mean by "because" is that due to the multiple opportunities, expectations upon immigrants are higher than would be realistic, e.g. the need to speak English, the need to have work experience, the need to have a degree, etc. Obviously, for refugees, the second and third are usually voided. However, some refugees cannot speak English and must thus try to assimilate into Australia culture without it. For immigrants, all 3 are required to get a job, as education overseas is much different to domestic education.
This forceful integration in Australian culture is viewed as detrimental to the cultural diversity of Australia, by Ouyang Yu.

In *The Ungrateful Immigrant*, Ouyang uses satire and high modality dialogue to express his regret at living in Australia; he does so by stating *"You expect me to speak English and write English  
Which I can do but not so that you think I am English"*
This highlights the social norm that is expected for immigrants, that they cannot continue to use their language, and instead are forced to speak English. He sees this as Australia trying to whitewash him, and thus he is dissatisfied with immigrant life.
Ouyang also views his decision to migrate as "an irreversible mistake", further showcasing his despair of his fading culture.

This is further evident in his representation of the aforementioned expectations; 
*"You expect me to be integrated into the mainstream  
I don’t care although I become a citizen  
Not to strengthen your national identity as you like to think"*

This notion of strengthening "national identity" nods towards the whitewashing of immigrants, in which they are encouraged strongly to be like other Australians, which again, are predominantly Caucasian. Thus, they are effectively losing their culture, in order to have a better life, something that Ouyang obviously views scathingly. 

The use of repetition of the phrase "you expect me to", and the word of "you" as a whole, points towards how immigrants are demanded to succumb to the government's demands, no matter how incorrect they may be, and this use of "you" creates a sense of alienation, to highlight the separation of culture between immigrants and refugees, and White Australians.

### An Identity CV

Now, this is an interesting poem. [An Identity CV](https://www.poetryinternational.com/en/poets-poems/poems/poem/103-817_AN-IDENTITY-CV) doesn't take the form of a traditional poem, in the sense of its structure. It's more of a resume of sorts, filled with scathing criticisms of the cultural elimination that Australia is undergoing, and the expectations heaped upon refugees that are seen as detrimental, by Ouyang. 

So the thing is, in this poem, Ouyang has a very harsh view of himself, perhaps in satire, to ridicule the social expectations of refugees/immigrants. 

He describes himself as a "cross-cultural fucker", and as "someone australia will regret to have". Again, the high modality language of "fucker" imply that being cross-cultural is undesirable, but by who? Well, "fucker" is a colloquialism used by Australians to insult someone, so he could be looking at himself as an immigrant, from a white Australian's point of view.
